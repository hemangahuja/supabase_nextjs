The problem at hand is to develop an efficient and reliable Proctored Exam Tool that automates the proctoring process and enables institutions, organizations, and testing agencies to administer secure and scalable remote examinations. 
The Proctored Exam Tool should aim to address the following challenges: 
    1. Remote Monitoring: The software should allow proctors to remotely observe the exam-takers via webcam and screen sharing to ensure that no unauthorized assistance is provided during the exam. 
    2. Identity Verification: Implement a robust identity verification mechanism to ensure that the exam-taker is the intended praticipants, preventing impersonation and fraud. 
    3. Cheating Prevention: Incorporate advanced monitoring features, such as real-time AI-based facial recognition, eye tracking, and suspicious behaviour detection, to identify and flag potential instances of cheating. 
    4. Secure Environment: Ensure that the exam environment remains secure by disabling access to unauthorized resources like other applications, websites, or external devices during the examination. 
    5. Data Privacy: The tool should adhere to stringent data privacy and security standards to protect sensitive information of both exam-takers and organisers. 
    6. User-friendly Interface: Design an intuitive and user-friendly interface for both proctors and exam-takers to facilitate easy navigation and seamless exam administration. 
    7. Scalability: The software should be capable of handling a large number of concurrent exam-takers without compromising on performance or security. 
    8. Compatibility: Ensure compatibility with different operating systems, browsers, and devices to accommodate diverse user preferences and accessibility needs. 
    9. Integration: The Proctored Exam Tool should be able to integrate with various application and assessment platforms commonly used in institutions, organizations, and testing agencies. 
    10. Reporting and Analytics: Provide comprehensive exam reports and analytics to assist institutions in evaluating exam performance, identifying trends, and making data-driven decisions.
